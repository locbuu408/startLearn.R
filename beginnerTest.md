# Introduction

The following are a set of self-test questions designed to complement the [beginnerConcepts](https://github.com/naheim/startLearn.R/blob/master/beginnerConcepts.md) tutorial. These exercises are only meant to be attempted **after** you have finished the beginnerConcepts tutorial.

## Loading in Data

We will be using several pre-built in datasets that come with R for this exercise. You can load them into R using the ````data( )```` function.

````R
# Data from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine. 
> data(mtcars)

# Measurements of the girth, height and volume of felled black cherry trees.
> data(trees)
  
# The average amount of precipitation (rainfall) in inches for U.S. cities.
> data(precip)
````
  
Note that you would normally expect to define the name of new objects using the ````<-```` operator, but the ````data( )```` function creates a new object for you automatically.

````R
# Take a quick look at the structure of each dataset.
# You can use the head( ) function to only display the first few rows of the dataset.

#### Problem Set 1
1. What **class** of object is ````mtcars````? What function did you use to find out?

2. Is ````precip```` defined as a **1-dimensional array** or a **vector**? How did you find out?

3. How would you convert the **data.frame** ````trees```` into a matrix?

4. What is the name of the 14th city in the ````precip```` dataset?

5. What function would you use if you wanted to combine all three data sets into a single object?

6. Does ````precip```` consist of numeric data? How did you find out?

7. Code **four** different ways to **subscript** the **2nd row** and **7th column** of ````mtcars```` using bracket notation - i.e., 17.02.

8. How would you change the precipitation values of "Juneau", "Phoenix", and "Sacramento" to 23, 46, and 12 in the ````precip```` dataset. (Hint: You will need to use **subscripts** and the ````<-````  operator).

9. Are there **any** trees in the ````trees```` dataset with more **girth** than **volume**? How did you find out?

10. Take the sum of all elements in column **height** of the trees dataset, call this value **A**. Take the sum of all elements in row **Valiant** of the **mtcars** dataset, call this value **B**. Take the sum of the first **8 elements** of the **precip** dataset, call this value **C**. Divide **C** by **B** and add **A**. What is your final answer?
