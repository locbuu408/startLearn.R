# Beginner Concepts

This section covers the most fundamental concepts of using R. Intermediate concepts are covered in [intermediateConcepts](intermediateConcepts.md) and advanced concepts are covered in [advancedConcepts](advancedConcepts.md). Use the [beginnerTest](beginnerTest.md) exercises to test your mastery of the concepts introduced in this tutorial. The '*test*' is not meant to provide a grade, but is a way for you and me to see how well you understand how to use R. If you're having trouble at any point, ask for help from one of the other interns or ask. Being efficient with R will really crucial this summer during the internship.

## The most basic R concepts

Throughout this tutorial there will be references to **objects** and **functions**. These are the two fundamental units of the R programming language. R stores information as objects and uses functions to interact with the objects. The following quote (not mine) summarizes the relationship quite well.

“Everything that **exists** in R is an object.
Everything that you **do** in R is a function.”

The line between objects and functions can become somewhat blurred because all functions are stored as objects and all objects can only be interacted with via functions. Don't be discouraged by this complexity, just remember the above quote and you will be fine.

## Why should you use R?

If you are ever feeling overwhelmed by what you are learning or doing in R, never forget that everything you do in R is just a **function** designed for one of the following **four** purposes. Determine which step you are trying to perform, and proceed from there. 

1. Mathematical Operations - Using R as a glorified calculator
2. Storing Data - Storing data in a format that allows you to perform a mathematical operation on it.
3. Reshaping Data - Changing the format of previously stored data so you can perform a different kind of operation on it.
4. Visualize Data - Methods to make graphs or other visual representations of stored data.

Although there are literally thousands of R functions, so long as you know a handful of basic methods for each of these four steps you can accomplish anything. This beginner's tutorial will largely focus on Mathematical Operations and Storing Data.

### The First Rule of R-Club
***"Always talk about R!"***

Spell things out for future readers of your programs as explicitly as possible – especially for me, because I’m grading you! You want other programmers to easily recognize what you are trying to accomplish with a particular line of code. A quote that I quite like is:

"Always annotate your code, because the sucker trying to figure what you did six months from now is going to be ***you***."

To do this you should always leave **thorough comments** in your code. Comments in R are always preceded by the ````#```` symbol. Anything that follows a # symbol will not be executed by the software.

````R
> # 2 * 5; everything on this line is a comment none of this will execute if you copy it into R
	
> 2 * 5 # comments can be placed after an expression. Whatever is in front of the # WILL execute.
[1] 10
````

### The Second Rule of R-Club

***"The computer is always right."***

As a beginner, you will often encounter errors. It is easy to become frustrated when the computer does not do what you want. However, remember that the computer ***"'tis naught but clockwork"*** and can only do what you tell it to do. If you are getting an error, it is almost certainly *your* fault. Don't despair and don't get mad. Take a deep breath, think about what you are trying to do, and try again.

## R as a fancy scientific calculator

If you have ever used a scientific or graphing calculator, then you already intuitively know all the basics of doing arithmetic in R. Yay, you've learned about 25% of R without doing anything! But, let's just start with a quick review anyway.

````R
# Addition
> 2+2
[1] 4

# Subtraction
> 5-3
[1] 2

# Multiplication
> 3*4
[1] 12

# Division
> 1/5
[1] 0.2

# Exponents
> 10^2
[1] 100
	
# Modulus (i.e., the remainder)
> 4 %% 2
[1] 0

# Make sure you always pay attention to the order of operations (i.e., PEMDAS). Compare the following two 
# expressions.

> (1+3)/(5/6)
[1] 4.8
	
> 1+3/5/6
[1] 1.1

# Also, be careful about those tricksy negative signs!
> -5^2
[1] -25

> (-5)^2
[1] 25
````

You can also perform what are called **logical operations**. A **logical** returns a value of either ````TRUE```` or ````FALSE````. Logicals are extraordinarily important in R.

````R
# Let's ask R if 0 is greater than 1
> 0 > 1
[1] FALSE

# What about if 5 is 1/2 of 10?
> 5 == (1/2 * 10)
[1] TRUE
````
	
Notice that we used ````==````  to ask if these two quantities are equal, rather than a single ````=```` sign. Most **operators** in R are  straightforward, but there are some - e.g., ````==```` - that are not intuitive. Here is a list of the basics. There are a few other operators in R, but we will worry about them later.

Operator Example | Operator Definition
---------------- | -------------------
x **>**  y | Is x **greater than** y
x **>=** y |	Is x **greter than or equal** to y
x **<**  y |	Is x **less than** y
x **<=** y |	Is x **less than or equal** to y
x **==** y |	Is x **equal** to y
x **!=** y |	Is x **not equal** to y

## Using functions for basic math

Of course, writing out the arithmetic every time wouldn't be any better than just using a calculator. The first benefit that R has over a calculator is it has many **functions** for arithmetic expressions that you can use as shortcuts.

````R
# For example, if I wanted to take the square root of a number. I could just write out the expression.
> 4^(1/2)
[1] 2

# But, I can use the sqrt() function to do this as well. Note that all functions have two parts. 
# The function name - e.g., sqrt - and a set of function arguments. Arguments are objects that you want 
# the function to evaluate - e.g., the number 4. Function arguments are always placed in
# parentheses.
> sqrt(4)
[1] 2
````

Now you might be thinking, that doesn't really save any time compared to writing out the expression. True, but functions will save you time on more complex expressions.

````R
# Let's try typing out 10!
> 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1
[1] 3628800

# Versus using the factorial function
> factorial(10) # much clearer!
[1] 3628800
````

The second most important benefit of functions is that they explicitly say what your code is doing - remember the first rule of R! Seeing ````factorial(10)```` makes it immediately obvious that you are calculating the factorial of ten.

## Storing data in an array

These simple functions probably still don't seem that impressive if you consider that most calculators already have buttons for square roots, factorials, and the like. However, functions in R don't really shine until they are paired with stored data.

Let's consider a quadratic equation, ````5x^2+3x+7````. Let's say we want to solve this equation for ````x=4```` that's easy to do in the way we've already learned.

````R
# 5x^2+3x+7, where x=4
> 5*(4^2)+(3*4)+7
[1] 99
````

But what if we want to solve this equation for multiple values of x? Let's try solving for x = 1,2,3, and 4. We can do this by telling R to perform the function on all four numbers at once using the `c()` command. 

````R
# The c() function tells R to treat the values inside the parentheses, separated by commas, as a single object.
> 5*c(1,2,3,4)^2+3*c(1,2,3,4)+7
[1] 15 33 61 99
````

But what if we had a very long equation and/or a very long list of x values we want solve for? Typing out all of the x values with c() every time x appears in the equation could get very hard to read very quickly.

````R
# Typing things out every time woudl defeat the whole point of using computers.
> 9*c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)^3+6*c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)^2+8*c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)+2
[1]   25  114  323  706 1317 2210 3439 5058 7121 9682
````

A better alternative involves learning how to store data as an **object**, and then plug the object into equations. The most fundamental type of data object in computer science is generally called an **array**. In R, there is an even more fundamental type of data object known as a **vector**. For now, let's talk about arrays.

An array is essentially a set of values saved to your computer memory that is referenced by a name.

````R
# Here's an example of how to make an array named "MyArray"
> MyArray<-array(data=c(1,2,3,4),dim=4)

# Once we've made the array named MyArray, then typing MyArray will return the values in the array.
> MyArray
[1] 1 2 3 4

# Similarly performing arithmetic on MyArray will apply that expression to all elements in MyArray 
> MyArray+4
[1] 5 6 7 9

# You can input MyArray into a function, and the function will be applied to each element (number) in the array
> factorial(MyArray)
[1]  1  2  6 24

> 5*MyArray^2+3*MyArray+7
[1] 15 33 61 99
````

## Differences between array (the object) and array( ) the function.

Remember that everything that **exists** in R is an **object** and everything that you **do** is a **function**. In the above example, ````MyArray```` is an object (specifically an array) that you created with the function ````array( )````.

If you are ever interested in knowing whether an object is an **array** or a **function**, you can use the function ````class( )````. All objects have a class.

````R	
> MyArray<-array(data=c(1,2,3,4),dim=4)
> class(MyArray)
[1] "array"
	
> class(array)
[1] "function"
````
	
Any time that you want to store the output of a function as an object, you use the ````<-```` operator, also known as the **assign** operator. In the ````MyArray```` example, ````<-```` tells R to store the output of the function on the right, ````array( )````, under the name on the left - i.e., ````MyArray````. 

````R	
# Here are some other examples
> FirstObject <- sqrt(5)
> FirstObject
[1] 2.236068

# Note that an existing object can be used to make a new object.
> SecondObject <- factorial(FirstObject^2)
> SecondObject
[1] 120
````

Let's talk some more about the ````array( )```` function, and functions in general. Aside from the **symbolic** operations described above (e.g., ````+````, ````-````, ````/````, ````>````, ````!=````, etc.), functions follow a simple format. They have a name (e.g., sqrt, factorial, array) that is followed by parentheses. Within these parentheses you place one or more **arguments** that tell the function what to do. 

````R
# Let's review the "MyArray" example again
> MyArray<-array(data=c(1,2,3,4),dim=4)
````

The ````data=```` is your way of telling it what data you want stored in the array. In this case, the numbers one, two, three, and four, but you could substitute any list of values or even a single value. 

````R
# Single value example
> SingleArray<-array(data=5,dim=1)
````

In other words data is the **argument** name, and you're telling it what values you want that argument to take. Another way of thinking about this is that you're telling R to *temporarily* create an **object** named **data** that the function ````array( )```` should use and then delete once the function completes. 

Similarly, ````dim=```` (short for dimensions) indicates how many values you want in the array. If you indicate more values to the array then you provide, R will simply repeat the values you did give it until the array is full.

````R
> MyArray<-array(data=c(1,2,3,4,5),dim=10)
> MyArray
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
````
	
Beware! This is a really bad behavior that most computer languages would not allow. The potential for introducing error into your calculation in this way isn't trivial, so be precise when defining your array size!

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of ````dim=```` is that you can also give it multiple values. Remember that when we want to treat multiple values as a single object we use the ````c( )```` function.

````R
# Two dimensional array
> TwoArray<-array(data=c(0,1),dim=c(4,6))
> TwoArray
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[2,]    1    1    1    1    1    1
[3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[4,]    1    1    1    1    1    1
````

Eseentialy, you told R to make 6 arrays with 4 values and store them within a single object named **TwoArray**.

````R
# You can do this as many times as you'd like. For example, 2 sets of 6 sets of arrays with 4 values.
> ThreeArray<-array(data=c(0,1),dim=c(4,6,2))
> ThreeArray
, , 1

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[2,]    1    1    1    1    1    1
[3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[4,]    1    1    1    1    1    1

, , 2

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[2,]    1    1    1    1    1    1
[3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[4,]    1    1    1    1    1    1
````

We therefore describe arrays based on the number of arrays referenced within them. A single array is a **1-dimensional array**. An array of arrays is a **2-dimensional array**. An array of arrays of arrays is a **3-dimensional array**, and so forth. 

Incidentally if you ever want to check the dimensions of an array, you can use the ````dim( )```` function.

````R
# Check the dim of MyArray
> dim(MyArray)
[1] 4 6 2
````

## The different types of data

What if we want to store something other than a number? There are a variety of data **types** in R, but there are only a few that you really need to know. Let's begin with the three most basic types.

Data Type | Definition
--------- | ----------
**logical** | **TRUE** or **FALSE**
**character** | Letters, numbers, and symbols that act like letters
**numeric** | Numbers that act like numbers

Type **logical** is fairly straightforward. It is simply a ````TRUE```` or a ````FALSE```` value. Note, however, that R will convert ````TRUE```` to ````1```` and ````FALSE```` to ````0```` if you try to perform basic mathematical operations on an array of logical data.

````R
# Create an array of logical values
> MyLogical<-array(data=c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE),dim=6)
> MyLogical
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
	
# Multiply your 1-dimensional array of logicals by 3
>MyLogical*3
[1] 3 3 0 3 0 3
	
# You can check what type of data you have using the typeof( ) function.
> typeof(MyLogical)
[1] "logical"
	
# Or if you have a specific guess you can use the is( ) function.
> is(MyLogical,"logical")
[1] TRUE
	
# If you want to see if ANY elements of your logical array are TRUE, use the any( ) function.
> any(MyLogical)
[1] TRUE
	
# If you want to see if ALL elements of your logical array are TRUE, use the all( ) function.
> all(MyLogical)
[1] FALSE
````
	
Type **character** is also fairly straightforward. It is basicaly a way of "de-mathing" something. You tell R that something is meant to be a character by using quotation marks ````" "````.

````R
# Create an array of characters made of letters
> MyCharacters<-array(data=c("Bob","Loves","Lucy","Almost","As","Much","As","He","Loves","R"),dim=10)
> MyCharacters
[1] "Bob"    "Loves"  "Lucy"   "Almost" "As"     "Much"   "As"     "He"     "Loves"  "R"
	
# Check the type
> typeof(MyCharacters)
[1] "character"
````

By "de-mathing", I mean that R will reject any attempts to do math on your array of characters, ***even if those characters are numbers***. It is extremely important to remember whether you want the word ````"word"```` or the **object** ````word````. Use quotations for the former, and no quotations for the latter. 

````R
# Create a vector of numbers as characters
> MyCharacters<-array(c("1","2","3","4"),dim=4)
[1] "1" "2" "3" "4"
	
# Attempt to add these numbers together using the sum( ) function.
> sum(MyCharacters)
Error in sum(MyCharacters) : invalid 'type' (character) of argument
````
	
We need to use ````" "```` marks so that R know you are not referencing an object.

````R
# Without " " marks returns an error because it thinks you are referencing an object.
# Read the error below, and memorize it, you may see it a lot.
> WithoutQuotes
Error: object 'WithoutQuotes' not found

# With " " marks returns a character string.
> "WithQuotes"
[1] "WithQuotes"
````

Type **numeric** is both a simple and complicated data type. Basically, numeric data are, you guessed it, numbers that you want to do math on.

````R
# Create a numeric array
> MyNumeric<-array(data=c(1,2,3,4),dim=4)

# Attempt to add all numbers in MyNumeric together
> sum(MyNumeric)
[1] 10

# Check if MyNumeric is of type numeric
> is(MyNumeric,"numeric") # Remember the is( ) function from before?
[1] TRUE

# Check its data type
> typeof(MyNumeric)
[1] "double"
````
	
It gives **double** instead of **numeric**! There are actually a couple of types of numeric data. For our intents and purposes, however, we will just consider **double** to be synonymous with **numeric** and leave it there for now.
	
### The Third Rule of R-Club

***"Data! Data! Data! I cannot add letters together."***

As you progress with R you will learn that keeping track of what **type** of data you are using becomes increasingly important. Most errors that beginners and intermediate useRs encounter are, on some level, a result of using the wrong data type. Therefore, one of the first things you should do when you get an error is double check that you are using the right type of data.

This is worth doing even if you are sure that you entered the data correctly. This is because some R functions will **coerce** (convert) your array from one data type into another without your realizing it. In most cases, this is actually a very convenient feature of R, but in other cases it can be the source of much frustration.

## Vectors and matrices as special arrays

The majority of work done in R is either 1- or 2-dimensional. This has led to the emergence of shorthand terms. A **vector** is a **one-dimensional** array and a **matrix** is a **two-dimensional array**. The overwhelming majority of R users exclusively use the **vector** and **matrix** terminology rather than **n-dimensional array** terminology. Importantly, not only is there a difference in terminology, there are actually separate functions, for convenience, that specifically use these terms.

````R
# Compare a 2-dimensional array
> x<-array(data=c(0,1),dim=c(4,6))
> x
	[,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[2,]    1    1    1    1    1    1
[3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[4,]    1    1    1    1    1    1

# With a Matrix. Notice that matrix( ) doesn't take a single dim= argument, 
# but rather has separate arguments for the number of rows (nrow) and columns (ncol)
> y<-matrix(data=c(0,1),nrow=4,ncol=6)
> y
	[,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[2,]    1    1    1    1    1    1
[3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[4,]    1    1    1    1    1    1

# We can check if these two objects are identical with the identical() function.
> identical(x,y)
[1] TRUE
	
# Or we can use the "**==**" operator
> x == y
[1] TRUE

# Based on what you've seen above, you may think that you have deduced the appropriate 
# pattern for writing out a vector.
> z<-vector(data=c(1,2,3,4),dim=4)
Error in vector(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), dim = 4) : 
unused arguments (data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), dim = 4)
````

Nope, doesn't work! Even though **vectors** are **conceptually identical** to a **1-dimensional array**, they are not **operationally identical**. Instead, you make a vector by using the ````c( )```` function we've been using all along. 
	
````R
# Make a vector 
> MyVector<-c(1,2,3,4)
> MyVector
[1] 1 2 3 4

# Let's make a 1-dimensional array.
> MyArray<-array(c(1,2,3,4),4)
> MyArray
[1] 1 2 3 4

# You can check what type of array something is by using the is() function
> is(MyVector,"vector")
[1] TRUE

# You can also convert between different types of class by using the as( ) function.
# Be warned that not all classes can be converted to other classes in this way.
> as(MyVector,"array")

# Let's test if the 1-D array, MyArray, is identical with the previous vector, MyVector.
> identical(MyVector,MyArray)
[1] FALSE

# Similarly, dim( ) will not work on a vector.
> dim(MyVector)
NULL
	
# You have to use the special function length( )
>length(MyVector)
[1] 4
````

If you look carefully at how we define arrays, you will notice that we need to first create a vector using the function ````c( )```` - e.g., ````MyArray<-array(````**c(1,2,3,4)**````,4)````.  Generally, vectors are used more often than 1-dimensional arrays because vectors are more fundamental. So, fair warning, be careful as to whether you are using **vectors**, **matrices**, or **arrays**.

## Referencing elements of an array

Each array is made up of a set of values. Each value within an array is known as an **element**.

````R
# Create a simple array with the array( ) function.
> MyArray<-array(data=c(5,6,7,8,9,10),dim=6)
> MyArray
[1] 5 6 7 8 9 10
````
	
In the above example, ````MyArray```` has six **elements**, the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. If you want to reference a specific element within the array, you use single brackets around the **index** or **position** of the element. 

````R
# Reference the 6th element of MyArray
> MyArray[6]
[1] 10
	
# Reference the 3rd element of MyArray
> MyArray[3]
[1] 7
````

You can also **name** the various **elements** within an array. You can do this (1) when the array is first created, or (2) after you've already created the array. For now, let's just add **names** to an existing array.

````R
# Add names to an existing array using the names function.
> MyArray<-array(data=c(5,6,7,8,9,10),dim=6)
	
# Let's check the names of MyArray using the names( ) function.
> names(MyArray)
NULL
````
	
Notice that there are no **names** attached to this array yet, so it returns an empty array - i.e., NULL.

````R
# You can store an array of names (as a character data type) to this empty array.
> names(MyArray)<-c("First","Second","Third","Fourth","Fifth","Sixth")
> MyArray
First Second  Third Fourth  Fifth  Sixth 
    5      6      7      8      9     10
    
# You can now access an element based on its **name**, rather than its **index** or **position**
# Find the fifth element.
> MyArray["Fifth"]
Fifth 
9 
````

What about those commas we saw before in the 2 and 3-dimensional array examples? The commas are used to separate out which dimension you are talking about. Here is an example.

````R	
# Let's make a 3-dimensional array, with 2 arrays of 6 arrays of 4 elements.
# Incidentally, notice that I'm going to use the ":" operator for the first time. 
# The colon means to make a sequence of numbers ranging from x to y - e.g., 1:4 = 1,2,3,4.
> ThreeArray<-array(data=c(1:48),dim=c(4,6,2))

The figure below depicts several other ways you can reference the elements within an array using bracket notation. Bracket notation, by the way, is known in R as **subscripting**. If you get an error that mentions **subscripts** then you know you used the wrong **index** when attempting to reference one or more elements of an array. This is a very common source of error, don't be discouraged if you get a lot of them when you're first starting out.

### The Fourth Rule of R-Club
***"R uses arrays too. Take advantage!"***

You may have noticed that throughout this tutorial R generally prefaces its answers to our questions with ````[1]````. That is its way of telling you that its response is the first element of an array - i.e., the invisible answer array. Because its answer is an array you can also **subscript** the answer.

````R
> ThreeArray<-array(data=c(1:48),dim=c(4,6,2))
	
# Find the dimensions of our new three dimensional array
> dim(ThreeArray)
[1] 4 6 2
	
# What if we just want to know the number of columns?
# You can subscript the output of dim( ) since it is also an array.
> dim(ThreeArray)[2]
[1] 6
````

## Multiple data types in an array

An important property of arrays is that they will ***only allow you to store one type of data within them***. For example, let's try to make a vector with both **characters**, **logicals**, and **numbers**.

````R
# My multi-datatype array
> MultiArray<-c(TRUE,1,2,3,4,"Bob")
> MultiArray
[1] "TRUE" "1"    "2"    "3"    "4"    "Bob" 

# Check to see the data type
> typeof(MultiArray)
[1] "character"
````

Notice that R simply **coerced** everything to type **character**. This is R's default behavior when you mix data types. If you want to store **multiple types** of data in a **single object** you are going to have to use a special type of array known as a **list**. Lists are created using the ````list( )```` function.

Lists are the most versatile form of data object. You can store multiple types of data in a variety of formats within a single list. You can even get fancy and have lists of lists. This is both a boon and an a bane, because this versatility makes them much more complex and difficult to use. Let's try to make MultiArray again using ````list( )````.

````R
# My multi-datatype array
> MultiList<-list(TRUE,1,2,3,4,"Bob")
> MultiList
[[1]]
[1] TRUE

[[2]]
[1] 1

[[3]]
[1] 2

[[4]]
[1] 3

[[5]]
[1] 4

[[6]]
[1] "Bob"
````

Although this output seems a bit cluttered and confusing with all of the extra brackets, it is actually very straightforward.

***All arrays are ultimately one-dimensional arrays*** (i.e., vectors) - in fact, properly speaking, there is no other kind of array in R or any computer language. We *simulate* two (or more) dimensional arrays by creating a one dimensional array whose **elements** are also arrays. There can be as many arrays nested within arrays as you want - e.g., a four dimensional array is an array of arrays of arrays of arrays.

**Lists** are just more explicit about this relationship than standard arrays. Let's try and illustrate this relationship with an example.

````R
# Create a 2-dimensional array of characters.
> MyCharacter<-array(c("a","b","c","d","e"),dim=c(5,5))
> MyCharacter
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] "a"  "a"  "a"  "a"  "a" 
[2,] "b"  "b"  "b"  "b"  "b" 
[3,] "c"  "c"  "c"  "c"  "c" 
[4,] "d"  "d"  "d"  "d"  "d" 
[5,] "e"  "e"  "e"  "e"  "e" 

# Create a 1-dimensional array of logicals
> MyLogicals<-array(c(TRUE,FALSE),dim=10)
> MyLogicals
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

# Create a 2-dimensional array of numerics
> MyNumerics<-array(c(1,2,3,4,5),dim=c(3,4))
> MyNumerics
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    2    5
[2,]    2    5    3    1
[3,]    3    1    4    2

# Bind each of these arrays together in a list.
> MyList<-list(MyCharacter,MyLogicals,MyNumerics)
> MyList
[[1]]
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] "a"  "a"  "a"  "a"  "a" 
[2,] "b"  "b"  "b"  "b"  "b" 
[3,] "c"  "c"  "c"  "c"  "c" 
[4,] "d"  "d"  "d"  "d"  "d" 
[5,] "e"  "e"  "e"  "e"  "e" 

[[2]]
	[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

[[3]]
    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    2    5
[2,]    2    5    3    1
[3,]    3    1    4    2
````

You can deduce from the output of ````MyList```` what the ````[[ ]]```` means. Just as single ````[ ]```` identify an **element** within an **array**, the ````[[ ]]```` identify an **object** within a list - usually another type of array.

````R
# Find the first array in MyList
> MyList[[1]]
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] "a"  "a"  "a"  "a"  "a" 
[2,] "b"  "b"  "b"  "b"  "b" 
[3,] "c"  "c"  "c"  "c"  "c" 
[4,] "d"  "d"  "d"  "d"  "d" 
[5,] "e"  "e"  "e"  "e"  "e" 
	
# See if it is identical to MyCharacter
> identical(MyList[[1]],MyCharacter)
[1] TRUE
	
# Access row 1, column 2 of the MyNumeric array in MyList
> MyList[[3]] [1,2]
[1] 4
````

You might think that you should use lists for everything since they are so flexible. However, as you may have noticed in the above examples, their output can be quite complex. Remember the first rule of R, clarity is king. Complex lists should be avoided whenever a simple array will suffice. Lists are also substantially slower in terms of computation.

#### A hybrid between lists and arrays

In addition to **lists** and **arrays**, there is a special kind of *hybrid* between 2-dimensional arrays (matrices) and lists known as a **data frame** (often written as **data.frame**). Data frames maintain the same structure as a two-dimensional array (matrix), but they allow you to have different types of data in **each column** like a list. 

Data frames are extremely desirable for data science. Imagine a clinical trial where you want to know the relationship between multiple variables. Some of the variables you want to keep track of might be best represented as **numeric** measurements (e.g., height, weight, age), **logical** measurements (e.g., TRUE = given real treatment, FALSE = given placebo), or **character** data (e.g., names, astrological sign). 

The versatility to keep track of all of these different data types within a single array makes data frames the most popular class of data object in R.

````R
# Make three different types of vector
> Weight<-c(85,110,75,70) # numeric
> Treatment<-c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) # logical
> Sign<-c("Libra","Scorpio","Cancer","Libra") # Character
	
# Create a vector of subject names
> Subjects<-c("Bob","Lucy","Tina","Joe")
	
# Combine them into a data frame
# Note that we also use the "row.names=" argument so that the vector Subjects becomes
# you guessed it, the row names.
> MyFrame<-data.frame(Weight,Treatment,Sign,row.names=Subjects)
	
     Weight Treatment    Sign
Bob      85      TRUE   Libra
Lucy    110     FALSE Scorpio
Tina     75      TRUE  Cancer
Joe      70     FALSE   Libra
````

There are several limitations, or at least caveats, you should consider before you start using data.frames for everything. First, data frames, ***like all arrays***, must be **symmetrical**.

````R
# Make a vector of length 4
> Weight<-c(85,110,75,70) # numeric
	
# Make a vector of length 3
> Age<-c(20,21,32)
	
# Attempt to combine them into a data frame.
> MyFrame<-data.frame(Weight,Age)
Error in data.frame(Weight, Age) : 
arguments imply differing number of rows: 4, 3
````
 	
In other words, data frames will only accept a series of 1-dimensional arrays (vectors) of ***equal length***. Only **lists** can be **asymmetrical**.

A second, lesser consideration, is that data frames are less computationaly efficient than matrices. Even something as simple as referencing a single element can be 10x slower on a data.frame than a matrix. Smaller matrices and data frames are so fast (nanoseconds) that people rarely notice the difference. Nevertheless, it is worth using matrices whenever possible because you never know if a **Big Data** worker might use one of your functions in the future.

The final consideration with data.frames is that they will, by default, convert your data of type **character** to type **factor**. **Factors** are one of R's best features, but will be covered in the [advancedConcepts](\advancedConcepts.md) tutorial. For now, if you want to preserve your **characters**, you need to change the ````stringsAsFactors=```` argument of the ````data.frame( )```` function to ````FALSE````.

````R
# Set stringsAsFactors= to FALSE in order to preserve characters as characters
> MyFrame<-data.frame(Weight,Treatment,Sign,row.names=Subjects,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
````

Be very mindful of this behavior, it is a common source of frustration.

## On the proper names of things.

A few parting notes on the different types of data object. First, **vectors**, **matrices**, **arrays**, **data.frames**, and **lists** are the most common classes of data object, but there are a variety of other - more specialized - data objects out there. Some programmers will create custom data object classes that only work with their own functions. So don't panic if you run across some class that you've never heard of before.

Also, be warned that there are two different funtions for naming elements in a data object, depending on the **class** of the object. If you are naming elements in a **vector** or **list** you should use the ````names( )```` function that we've already illustrated. If you are naming the elements in an **array** (including **data.frames** and **matrices**, of course), you will need to use the ````dimnames( )```` function.

````R
# Create a three dimensional array
> Delivered<-array(data=c(1,2,3,4),dim=c(3,3,2))
> Delivered
, , 1

     [,1] [,2] [,3]

# If you want to rename the first dimension of the object.
> dimnames(Delivered)[[1]]<-c("Frank","Joe","Bob")
> Delivered
, , 1

      [,1] [,2] [,3]

# If you want to rename second dimension of the object.
> dimnames(Delivered)[[2]]<-c("Pizzas","Burgers","Salads")
> Delivered
, , 1

      Pizzas Burgers Salads
Frank      1       4      3
Joe        2       1      4
Bob        3       2      1

, , 2

      Pizzas Burgers Salads
Frank      2       1      4
Joe        3       2      1
Bob        4       3      2

# If you want to rename the third dimension of the object
> dimnames(Delivered)[[3]]<-c("Monday","Tuesday")
> Delivered
, , Monday

      Pizzas Burgers Salads
Frank      1       4      3
Joe        2       1      4
Bob        3       2      1

      Pizzas Burgers Salads

Joe        3       2      1
Bob        4       3      2
````

Names are very powerful in R. Just by looking at the name of the array and its elements, you could make a reasonable guess that the array ````Delivered```` is a set of tables for how many **Pizzas**, **Burgers**, and **Salads** that **Frank**, **Joe**, and **Bob** **delivered** on **Monday** and **Tuesday**. Remember, conveying constant information to whoever is reading your code is the first and most important rule of R! Never forget!
